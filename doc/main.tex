% hyperref makes hyperlinks in the resulting PDF.
% If your build breaks (sometimes temporarily if a hyperlink spans a page)
% please comment out the following usepackage line and replace

% Attempt to make hyperref and algorithmic work together better:
\newcommand{\theHalgorithm}{\arabic{algorithm}}

% Use the following line for the initial blind version submitted for review:
% \usepackage{icml2025}

% If accepted, instead use the following line for the camera-ready submission:
\usepackage[accepted]{icml2025}

\subsection{表示定义的格式}

示例：definition
\begin{definition}
\label{def:inj}
A function $f:X \to Y$ is injective if for any $x,y\in X$ different, $f(x)\ne f(y)$.
\end{definition}

示例：proposition
Using \cref{def:inj} we immediate get the following result:
\begin{proposition}
If $f$ is injective mapping a set $X$ to another set $Y$, 
the cardinality of $Y$ is at least as large as that of $X$
\end{proposition}

示例：proof
\begin{proof} 
Left as an exercise to the reader. 
\end{proof}

示例：lemma
\begin{lemma}
\label{lem:usefullemma}
For any $f:X \to Y$ and $g:Y\to Z$ injective functions, $f \circ g$ is injective.
\end{lemma}

示例：theorem
\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:bigtheorem}
If $f:X\to Y$ is bijective, the cardinality of $X$ and $Y$ are the same.
\end{theorem}

示例：corollary
\begin{corollary}
If $f:X\to Y$ is bijective, 
the cardinality of $X$ is at least as large as that of $Y$.
\end{corollary}

示例：assumption
\begin{assumption}
The set $X$ is finite.
\label{ass:xfinite}
\end{assumption}

示例：remark
\begin{remark}
According to some, it is only the finite case (cf. \cref{ass:xfinite}) that is interesting.
\end{remark}
